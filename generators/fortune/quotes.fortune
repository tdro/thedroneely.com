guessed, it will always for the purpose of convenience, expediency, political

or any combination of the above, or none of the above, be unilaterally and
unequivocally assumed, proclaimed, and adhered
to as absolute truth to be undeniably, universally, immutably, and infinitely
so, until such time as it
becomes advantageous to assume otherwise, maybe.

same range of programs. However, they say deeply different things about

practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. This is why we
do not agree with open source, and do not use that term. — Richard Stallman
