<p>Voice acting is one of my interests, and I&rsquo;ve made a website to manage just that.
There were a few super simple html/css/javascript websites that I created before this one but
I consider this my first formal website that actually does something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made using a combination of <a href="https://secure.php.net">PHP</a> for dynamic content and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> for static content &ndash; a <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> database for the backend, and <a href="https://www.nginx.com">Nginx</a> as the web
server. Everything sits behind a front controller and the project structure is based on a very barebones implementation of the <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a>
framework. To manipulate the content on the site, markdown files are edited and the static components of the website
are recompiled by <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The comment section is handled by a PHP commenting system called <a href="http://tildehash.com/?page=hashover">HashOver</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>The original intention was to program a full CMS backend UI that would play nice with Hugo serverside to update the markdown files,
but the web development world is either very clever or lazy? Recently I discovered the concept of a <a href="https://headlesscms.org">Headless CMS</a>
and yes &mdash; I honestly don&rsquo;t have the slightest clue of what that term really means.</p>

<p>In the future, it would be nice to have the remaining CMS functionality integrated into a self-hosted <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> instance
(looks like it&rsquo;s open source). This will use either gitlab&rsquo;s or github&rsquo;s API to update the static parts of the website
and will provide not only version control but a stupid simple interface for making changes to the website. I&rsquo;ve got some more
reading to do.</p>
